I have not done the traditional way towards making the "Snake" Game. As I wanted to try and make something different, which has resulted 
in making a more complicated version of the game. So please keep that in mind when you look at my code. Whereas, in the original game I 
could just take the last cube and put it to the front of the tail, in this version I could not.

Also I have built an executable of the game if you want to play that versus loading my whole project in Unity.
